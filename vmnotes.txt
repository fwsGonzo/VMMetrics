Single-threaded Apache2 httpd on virt-manager with default Ubuntu 16.04:
66 samples
* Average total CPU time: 19
* Average guest CPU time: 8
* Average requests/sec:   2967.93 req/s

IncludeOS Acorn httpd on virt-manager:
66 samples
* Average total CPU time: 5
* Average guest CPU time: 3
* Average requests/sec:   8598.19 req/s

NodeJS httpd on virt-manager with default Ubuntu 16.04:
66 samples
* Average total CPU time: 24
* Average guest CPU time: 13
* Average requests/sec:   2334.69 req/s

Apache2 uses 3.8 times more CPU time than IncludeOS to do *LESS* work
Apache2 is configured to send a file, index.html, with nothing else behind it
The index.html file used is the wget result from the one in Acorn running on IncludeOS
IncludeOS performs 2.9 times better than Apache2 in this test

NodeJS uses 4.8 times more CPU time than IncludeOS, but it does more or less the same amount of work
Our NodeJS test is using http-dispatcher as the routing plugin to achieve same functionality
The index.html file used is the wget result from the one in Acorn running on IncludeOS
IncludeOS performs 3.7 times better than NodeJS in this test

Note: To get IncludeOS to run in virt-manager select NIC driver "virtio" and use "Specify shared device name" 
with bridge name "include0". Start Acorn and verify the bridge works with: ping 10.0.0.42
